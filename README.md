This repository is to offer a code that will plot for you f(x,y) in two ways:
1. A mesh - the whole 3D graph will be represented by mesh.
2. With colors - each part of the graph will be colored according to its height relative to the Z axis (higher points will be bluish, while lower points will be more pinkish).
